# Data Science Portfolio
Repository containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for academic, self learning, and hobby purposes. Presented in the form of Jupyter notebooks.

<h2> working on </h2>

Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
Install all dependencies that are necessary for the project.
Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, Vscode etc.

<h3> Data Analysis on volcanic eruption data </h3>
</a>

- The Smithsonian Institution’s Global Volcanism Program (GVP) documents Earth’s volcanoes and their eruptive history over the past 10,000 years
- The GVP database includes the names, locations, types, and features of more than 1,500 volcanoes with eruptions during the Holocene period (approximately the last 10,000 years) or exhibiting current unrests.

<h3>Dogs vs cats</h3>
</a>

- In this notebook i used the data from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/dogs-vs-cats">kaggle</a> competion. 
- In this dataset there are two classes (Dogs and Cats) we need classfy them. So, for this i have created a classifier with the help of tensorflow and keras.
- Here's the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/code/priyanshusahu23/dogs-vs-cats">link</a> of the project.
